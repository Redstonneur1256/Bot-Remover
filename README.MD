# BotProtector
A Mindustry plugin to prevent bot attacks.

The plugin currently uses IP filtering to block IPs from various hosting/vpn providers. It is planned
for the plugin to use actual attack detection rather than IP filtering in the future.

This plugin requires [ModLib](https://github.com/Redstonneur1256/Mindustry-ModLib).
Supports statistics with [UnifiedMetrics](https://github.com/Redstonneur1256/UnifiedMetrics).
